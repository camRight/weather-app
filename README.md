and I wanted to create something more intuitive or informative than the provided mockup.

## Mock Up

I based this project on a mockup--simulating when a client needs a web page designed with certain specs and functionality--I wanted to get
as close as possible to the intended goal, but also saw room for improvement in the way the information was layed out. Subsequently, ternary
expressions were used to evaluate the data and provide a color-based UI experience based on the information the API provided.

The mockup includes a search option, a list of cities searched, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions.
